            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>The PATH HIVST Facebook Messenger chatbot is a platform that allows individuals to get information about HIV self-testing kits, where to buy them, and resources on how to use the HIV self-testing kit. Let our chatbot be your home too, and it can be a friendly and confidential bridge between you and community clinics or pharmacies giving our free or paid for HIV self-testing kit.</p>

            <p>
            <h3>What data do we collect?</h3>
            The chatbot collects the following data:
                <ul>
                    <li>Personal identification information. In this context, Personal identification information means the name, email address, phone number, gender of the user. We emphasize that personal identification information is collected with the user’s full and free consent.</li>
                </ul>
            For the purpose of this data and privacy policy, the data collected is in reference to the use of the chatbot.

                    <li>Personal identification information. In this context, Personal identification information means the name, email address, phone number, gender of the user. We emphasize that personal identification information is collected with the user’s full and free consent.</li>

            <h3>How do we collect your information?</h3>
            <h4>Automatically collected information:</h4>
            Our chatbot automatically collects the personal information provided by Facebook. This includes your public user profile information and limited to Facebook PSID, and full names.
            <h4>Interactively collected information</h4>
            In addition to the automatically collected data described above, we have an onboarding process as part of the chatbot user journey and collect personal information which aids us to have a better insight into our users so as to serve you better on your future interaction.
            
            The information collected includes gender, phone numbers, year of birth, and the Uganda  Ministry of Health(MoH) approved eligibility criteria for HIV testing which checks if a user is eligible for a free HIV self-testing kit or not.

            </p>
            <p>
            <h3>Information you choose to give us</h3>
            The moment you choose to send us a Facebook messenger message through our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PATH-HIVST-Chatbot-107220691469495">Facebook Page PATH HIVST Chatbot</a>. 
            Occasionally, we may run surveys to collect feedback from audiences which may necessitate asking for identification information– so if you participate in such exercises, we’ll ask for that information and we’ll use it only for those two specific purposes.
            <br>
            <p>You directly provide the chatbot with the data we collect. We collect and process this data when you:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Click on the Get Started Button on Facebook messenger.</li>
                    <li>Respond to the information we ask for the onboarding process.</li>
                    <li>Consent to receive HIV prevention messages through SMS.</li>
                </ul>
                We may send you messages regarding our services, surveys, or training that we think might be of interest to you once in a while and you’ll be able to voluntarily opt-out at any point in time. 
            </p>
            <h3>How does the chatbot secure and store your information?</h3>
            We take precautions to protect collected personal information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction, taking into account the risk level and the nature of the data. You are responsible for taking every reasonable precaution on your end to protect any unauthorized person from accessing your account chat history with the chatbot. During data transport, data is encrypted using a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) to protect your personal information. The data is then stored and anonymized in secure databases. However, due to the design of the Internet and other factors outside our control, we cannot guarantee that communications between you and our servers will be free from unauthorized access by third parties.
            </p>
            <p>
            <h3>How is your information used?</h3>

Unless otherwise noted, any changes we make to this privacy policy will become effective immediately once posted on this page. Your continued use of the services following any changes to this privacy policy indicates your consent to the practices described in the revised privacy policy.
