All reactive (positive) self-test results\nneed to be confirmed by a trained tester using a validated national testing algorithm. Non-reactive\n(negative) self-test results are considered negative. However, in accordance with existing WHO\nHIVST guidance individuals who may have been exposed to HIV in the past 6 weeks and those at\nhigh on-going risk (such as key populations) are advised to retest.
